<p> I work as a Senior Applied Reserach Scientist at Unlikely AI. My work focuses on using AI to solve problems where a mere answer is not enough. I primarily explore techniques which can be thought of exploration of program space by thinking of a reasoned output from a machine learning model as an executable program. The methods are based on combining generative and classical AI in creative ways. <br></p>

<p>Previously, at Invenia Labs I worked on novel forecasting methods for high dimensional, heavy tailed data.  <br></p>

<p>I was a Senior Research Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge, led by <a href="https://www.fahim-kawsar.net/">Fahim Kawsar</a>, where our group worked on Ubiquitous Computing and Human-computer interaction. My own work mainly focused on machine learning under dataset shift.<br></p>

<p>I worked as a Senior Researcher as part of the Advanced Research Labs at <a href="https://www.nokia.com/networks/technologies/">Nokia Technologies</a>, where I worked on various applications of machine learning in image processing, biometrics and sensing.<br></p>

<p>I did my PhD in mathematics at the University of Cambridge. My specialisation was in algebraic geometry and geometric analysis.
